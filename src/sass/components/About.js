                            Software engineering isn't just a careerâ€”it's my lifelong calling. With a strong technical foundation encompassing Python, React, JavaScript, and more, I bring a unique blend of expertise and passion to every project.

My diverse background, from backpacking through Latin America to serving in the US Navy, shapes my holistic perspective in problem-solving and innovation. Coding isn't just a skill; it's my passionâ€”a journey of continuous growth. As a developer, I'm here to create, innovate, and bring visions to life through the power of code.
